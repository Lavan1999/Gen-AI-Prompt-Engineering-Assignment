# Brief Explanation of the Text Generation Task
## Objective: 
Create a text generation model using a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## Steps Taken:
## Setup Environment:

Installed the necessary libraries: transformers and torch.
## Load Pre-trained Model:

Imported AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForCausalLM from transformers.
Set up the Hugging Face token and loaded the gpt2 model and its tokenizer.
Moved the model to GPU if available.
## Generate Text:

Defined a function generate_text that takes a prompt and generates coherent text using the model.
Used parameters such as max_length, num_return_sequences, do_sample, no_repeat_ngram_size, temperature, top_k, and top_p to control text generation.
Tested the function with different prompts to evaluate coherence.
## Evaluate Model Performance:

* BLEU Score: Evaluated using the nltk library to measure the similarity between generated and reference texts.
* ROUGE Score: Used the rouge-score library to assess the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between generated and reference texts.
Perplexity: Measured to evaluate how well the model predicts a sample, though the exact implementation details were not shown in the provided code.
## Summary of Results:

The generated text was coherent and relevant to the provided prompts.
Evaluation metrics (BLEU and ROUGE scores) indicated the quality and effectiveness of the text generation model. High ROUGE scores suggest good overlap with reference texts, while BLEU scores indicate translation quality.
