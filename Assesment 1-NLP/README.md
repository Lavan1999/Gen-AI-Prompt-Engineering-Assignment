# NLP Task Workflow
Import Libraries: Begin by importing essential Python libraries such as nltk for natural language processing, sklearn for machine learning tools, and pandas for data handling.

* Data Collection: 
Load the dataset (e.g., Amazon product reviews) into a DataFrame using pandas. This dataset includes columns like Name, Stars, Title, and Description.

* Data Cleaning:
Define a function to preprocess text data by converting all characters to lowercase and removing special characters, ensuring uniformity and cleanliness of the text.

* Tokenization:
Apply tokenization to the cleaned text to split it into individual words. This helps in further text analysis and processing.

* Stopword Removal:
Remove common stopwords (e.g., 'and', 'the') from the tokenized text to focus on meaningful words that contribute to the analysis.

* Vectorization: 
Convert the processed text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization. This step transforms text data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

* Sentiment Analysis: 
Implement sentiment analysis using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool from nltk to classify the sentiment of the text as positive, negative, or neutral.
