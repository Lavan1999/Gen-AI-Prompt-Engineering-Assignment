# Workflow for the API Integration Assessment
## 1. Setup
- Install dependencies: Ensure the requests library is installed using pip install requests.
- API Keys: Obtain necessary API keys for both the OpenWeatherMap and NASAâ€™s APOD API.
## 2. OpenWeatherMap API Integration
- Functionality: A Python script to fetch current weather data for a specified city.
- API Call: Use requests.get() to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API, passing the city and API key as parameters.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling with response.raise_for_status() to catch potential issues such as invalid API keys or bad requests.
- Data Parsing: Parse the JSON response using response.json() and extract relevant weather information.
- User-Friendly Display: Format and display the fetched weather data using json.dumps() with indentation for better readability.
## 3. NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API Integration
- Functionality: A script to fetch and display the Astronomy Picture of the Day along with its title and description.
- API Call: Use requests.get() to retrieve the APOD from NASA's API, passing the API key.
- Error Handling: Similar to OpenWeatherMap, use response.raise_for_status() for error handling.
- Data Parsing: Convert the response into a Python dictionary using response.json() and extract the title, description, and image URL.
- User-Friendly Display: Print out the title, description, and image URL in a clean format for easy understanding.
## 4. Error Handling
- HTTP Errors: Handle API errors (e.g., invalid API keys, incorrect parameters) using requests.HTTPError.
- General Errors: Use a generic Exception block to catch any other errors such as network issues.
## 5. Output
- Weather Data: Display weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general conditions in a formatted JSON structure.
- APOD Data: Display the Astronomy Picture of the Day's title, description, and a direct link to the image.
## 6. Conclusion
The scripts efficiently fetch data from external APIs, handle errors gracefully, and present the information in a user-friendly format.
