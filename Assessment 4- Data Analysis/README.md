# Data Analysis Workflow
## 1. Data Collection
Gathered historical weekly sales data of various stores along with supplementary information like unemployment rates, holidays, and fuel prices.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, checking for inconsistencies, and formatting date columns.
Filtered the data based on conditions like store type, holidays, and economic factors (e.g., unemployment rate).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted preliminary analysis to understand the distribution of sales across stores, departments, and time periods.
Used statistical techniques to explore correlations between variables like fuel price, unemployment rate, and sales.

## 4. Key Analyses Performed
Store Type Comparisons: Calculated the average sales for different store types in specific months and across holidays.
Leap Year Analysis: Identified underperforming stores in leap years.
Unemployment Impact: Assessed department sales when unemployment rates were high (> 8%).
Weekly Sales Leaderboards: Determined which stores recorded the highest weekly sales and lowest fuel prices.
Offer-Free Sales: Evaluated store performance without promotional markdowns.

## 5. Visualization
Created charts and graphs to visualize key insights, such as sales trends, best-performing stores, and department comparisons.

## 6. Result Summary
Summarized the findings in concise points, highlighting the best and worst performing stores, departments, and external factors affecting sales.
